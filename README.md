## This repository
In this repository, you find several folders necessary to run the system:
1. In the *Confidentiality Manager* folder, you find all the necessary files to run the Confidentiality Manager.
2. In the *Evaluation tool* folder you can find the tool used to run all the tests and to produce the ``Execution Analysis'' of the paper.
3. The *Performance Analysis* folder contains all the images on the tests performed with their cost and time tables.
4. The *Process Manager* folder contains the files needed to run the Process Manager.
5. The *Running example files* folder contains the two files used as inputs for the running example of the paper (an X-ray BPMN choreography), and the references to the deployed smart contracts where you can find all the transactions.
