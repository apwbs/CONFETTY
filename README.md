# CONFETTY

This repository contains the implementation of the CONFidentiality EnforcemenT TransparencY (CONFETTY) approach presented in the paper 
entitled: "[Balancing Confidentiality and Transparency for Blockchain-based Process-Aware Information Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05737)" submitted at the 37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering, [CAiSE 25](https://conferences.big.tuwien.ac.at/caise2025/).

<!--## Wiki
Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/apwbs/CONFETTY/wiki) for a detailed documentation and step-by-step tutorial to run the system locally.-->

## This repository
In this repository, you find several folders necessary to run the system. 
1. The *Process Manager* folder contains the files needed to run the Process Manager. Check the READ.me of the Manager for a detailed requirements list.
2. In the *Confidentiality Manager* folder, you find all the necessary files to run the Confidentiality Manager. For a more detailed tutorial, please check the [MARTSIA-Wiki](https://github.com/apwbs/MARTSIA-Demo-KoB).
3. In the *Evaluation tool* folder you can find the tool used to run all the tests and to produce the ``Execution Analysis'' of the paper.
4. The *Running example files* folder contains the two files used as inputs for the running example of the paper (an X-ray BPMN choreography), and the references to the deployed smart contracts where you can find all the transactions.
